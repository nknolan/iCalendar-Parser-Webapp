## Assignment 3
04/2019 — iCalendar webapp.

### To Run

First run `npm install`, then go to the /parser directory and run `make`

To host the website at localhost, use `nmp run dev PORTNUM` where `PORTNUM` is whichever port number you want to use. This hosts the site at `localhost:PORTNUM`.

***

This final update includes an interface for a mySQL database with tables for information from iCalendar files. There are several predefined queries for getting particular calendar information from the database. Using the database requires a login (at the bottom of the web page) and does not replace the original file system.
